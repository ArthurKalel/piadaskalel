                It all started with the Facebook page created in 2020, during the pandemic, to pass the time. Although the
                page was paralyzed for a while, now it returns together with its version for Instagram and this site.
                <p>There's not much of a secret, I have fun posting the content, and I hope you have fun too!</p>
